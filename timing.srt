00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,600
my grandfather, a

00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,100
man of few

00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:02,700
words and even

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,799
fewer smiles, ran

00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:04,299
a tow truck

00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:05,200
business in the

00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,500
sleepy town of

00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,900
harmony creek. he

00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,599
inherited it from

00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:08,400
his father, who

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,400
in turn inherited

00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:09,699
it from his.

00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:11,099
it was a

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,099
legacy, a gritty,

00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,199
grease-stained legacy that

00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:14,800
i, unfortunately, was

00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,500
next in line

00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,800
to inherit. i

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,199
say unfortunately because

00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:18,699
i had dreams

00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:19,399
of being a

00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:20,199
writer, not a

00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,600
mechanic. but family

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,300
is family, and

00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,199
in harmony creek,

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,600
family obligations were

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,399
thicker than motor

00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,500
oil. growing up,

00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,300
i spent my

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:27,699
summers in the

00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:28,600
garage, the smell

00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,399
of gasoline and

00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,500
burnt rubber permanently

00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,199
etched into my

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,700
nostrils. i learned

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,700
to identify every

00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,399
make and model

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:34,899
of car by

00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:35,799
its mangled remains,

00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:36,399
and i could

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,299
probably rebuild an

00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:38,799
engine blindfolded. but

00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:39,399
my heart wasn't

00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:40,399
in it. i

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,100
yearned for the

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,000
quiet solitude of

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,200
a library, the

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,000
thrill of crafting

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,399
stories, not the

00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,299
monotony of hauling

00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:47,700
wrecks. then came

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,500
barry. barry moved

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,200
to harmony creek

00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,700
from the city,

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,200
a slick-haired, fast-talking

00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,000
salesman with a

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
penchant for flashy

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,200
cars and even

00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,000
flashier promises. he

00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,899
opened a competing

00:00:58,899 --> 00:00:59,500
tow truck business,

00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,600
"barry's speedy towing,"

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,000
and immediately started

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,400
undercutting my grandfather's

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,099
prices. he poached

00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,299
clients, spread rumors,

00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:08,400
and generally made

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,299
life miserable for

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,000
us. my grandfather,

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,900
a man of

00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,500
principle, refused to

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,200
stoop to barry's

00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,299
level. he believed

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,099
in honest work

00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:17,000
and fair prices.

00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,799
but barry's tactics

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,400
were working. our

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,500
business dwindled, and

00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,000
the weight of

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,799
the family legacy

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,000
felt heavier than

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,799
ever on my

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,200
shoulders. i watched

00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,299
as my grandfather's

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,299
shoulders slumped, his

00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:29,799
once-steady hands trembling

00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,400
with worry. one

00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,799
sweltering afternoon, i

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,400
was dispatched to

00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,000
a call on

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,500
the outskirts of

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,900
town. a pickup

00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,599
truck had veered

00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,000
off the road

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,700
and into a

00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,799
ditch. as i

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,400
winched the truck

00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,200
out, i noticed

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,000
something peculiar. the

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,700
ditch was unusually

00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,000
deep, almost perfectly

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,299
carved out. and

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:45,900
there were fresh

00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,000
tire tracks leading

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,500
away from the

00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,599
scene, tracks that

00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,099
didn't belong to

00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:50,799
the pickup. a

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,500
seed of suspicion

00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,299
began to sprout

00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:52,799
in my mind.

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,400
i remembered seeing

00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,200
barry's truck in

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,900
the area earlier

00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,099
that day. could

00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:57,500
he have been

00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,000
involved? the thought

00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,900
was unsettling, but

00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,799
the more i

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,599
considered it, the

00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,200
more it made

00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,900
sense. barry was

00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,200
ruthless, desperate for

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,400
business. would he

00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,799
go so far

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,700
as to sabotage

00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,599
someone else's vehicle?

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,400
i decided to

00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,000
investigate. i spent

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,400
the next few

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,599
days discreetly observing

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,599
barry's operations. i

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,400
noticed he seemed

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:16,800
to be spending

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,099
a lot of

00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:17,900
time near the

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,000
old highway bypass,

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
a stretch of

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,800
road known for

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,900
its treacherous curves

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,699
and frequent accidents.

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,400
i also noticed

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,300
that the accidents

00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:25,500
seemed to be

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,199
happening more frequently

00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,500
since barry arrived.

00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:28,900
one night, i

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,900
followed barry's truck

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,300
as he drove

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,599
out to the

00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,199
bypass. i parked

00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,000
a safe distance

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
away and watched

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,699
through my binoculars.

00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:36,000
i saw him

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,699
stop near a

00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:37,800
sharp bend, get

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,000
out of his

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,300
truck, and carefully

00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,000
place a pile

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,500
of rocks in

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:40,699
the middle of

00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:42,000
the road. then,

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,199
he hid in

00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:43,800
the bushes and

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,099
waited. a few

00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,199
minutes later, a

00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,000
car came speeding

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,699
around the bend.

00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:48,599
it hit the

00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,300
rocks, swerved violently,

00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,400
and crashed into

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,099
the guardrail. barry

00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:53,699
emerged from the

00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:54,800
bushes, called the

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,900
police, and then

00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,800
proceeded to tow

00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,300
the wrecked car

00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:57,800
back to his

00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,099
lot. i had

00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:00,500
my proof. barry

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,400
was deliberately causing

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
accidents to drum

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,699
up business. the

00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:04,400
anger that had

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,199
been simmering inside

00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:05,800
me for weeks

00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,900
finally boiled over.

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,000
i knew i

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,500
couldn't let him

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:08,900
get away with

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,099
this. but i

00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:10,500
also knew that

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:10,900
going to the

00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,599
police with my

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,500
story wouldn't be

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,900
enough. barry was

00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,500
a smooth talker,

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,400
and he'd likely

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,199
weasel his way

00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:16,400
out of it.

00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:17,699
i needed to

00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,199
hit him where

00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:18,900
it hurt, to

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,000
expose his scheme

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,300
in a way

00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:20,699
that would ruin

00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:22,099
him. i spent

00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:22,500
the next few

00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,699
days meticulously planning

00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:24,699
my revenge. i

00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,400
gathered evidence, documented

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,699
barry's activities, and

00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:28,599
crafted a narrative

00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:28,900
that would be

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,699
impossible to ignore.

00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:31,300
i even enlisted

00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:31,599
the help of

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,400
a local journalist,

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,500
a woman who

00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,099
had a reputation

00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,500
for uncovering corruption

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,599
and holding the

00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,699
powerful accountable. finally,

00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:39,900
the day arrived.

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,400
the journalist published

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,900
her story, detailing

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,900
barry's scheme and

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,699
presenting the evidence

00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:45,500
i had gathered.

00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,199
the story went

00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,500
viral, sparking outrage

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,400
in the community.

00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,099
barry's speedy towing

00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:52,400
was immediately boycotted,

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,300
and his reputation

00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,000
was shattered. but

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,599
that wasn't enough.

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,900
i wanted to

00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,500
make sure he

00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,000
paid for his

00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,599
crimes. i contacted

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,300
the families of

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:00,800
the victims of

00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,099
barry's staged accidents

00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,199
and encouraged them

00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,099
to file lawsuits.

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,000
they did, and

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,599
barry was soon

00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,500
drowning in legal

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,599
fees. in the

00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,800
end, barry's speedy

00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
towing went bankrupt,

00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,099
and he was

00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:11,800
forced to leave

00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,000
harmony creek in

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,500
disgrace. my grandfather's

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,800
business recovered, and

00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,600
the town breathed

00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,500
a collective sigh

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,699
of relief. as

00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:19,600
for me, i

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,000
didn't become a

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
writer. but i

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,800
did learn a

00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,300
valuable lesson about

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,199
justice and the

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,100
importance of standing

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,699
up for what's

00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,399
right. and sometimes,

00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,600
the best stories

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,000
are the ones

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,899
you live, not

00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:29,399
the ones you

00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,699
write. and i

00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:31,199
was happy to

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:31,600
be the one

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
to tow barry

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:32,899
out of town.
