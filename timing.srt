00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,399
My life is

00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:01,800
usually a quiet

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,000
one. I work

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,600
from home as

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,200
a freelance writer,

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:04,900
which means my

00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,599
days are spent

00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:06,099
in the comforting

00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:06,900
silence of my

00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,699
apartment, punctuated only

00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:09,300
by the gentle

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,000
clatter of my

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
keyboard and the

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,099
occasional meow of

00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:12,900
my cat, Luna.

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,500
I value peace

00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,500
and tranquility above

00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,399
almost everything, finding

00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:18,199
that it's essential

00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:18,800
for my creativity

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,600
and overall well-being.

00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,800
That's why I

00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,500
chose this particular

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,800
apartment complex â€“

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,100
it was known

00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:25,699
for its strict

00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:26,600
noise policies and

00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,399
respectful residents. Or

00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:28,800
so I thought.

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,300
Enter Mark, my

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,500
new neighbor. He

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,100
moved in a

00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,500
few weeks ago,

00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,600
and ever since,

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,700
my peaceful existence

00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,600
has been shattered.

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,200
It started subtly,

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
with slightly louder-than-usual

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,700
TV sounds in

00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,200
the evenings. I

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,500
figured he was

00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,200
just settling in

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,100
and would eventually

00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,000
adjust the volume.

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,299
But then came

00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:47,100
the parties. Loud,

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,100
thumping bass that

00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,799
vibrated through my

00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,700
walls, drunken shouts

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,500
and laughter that

00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,000
echoed through the

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,600
hallways, and music

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,299
that seemed to

00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:55,100
penetrate every corner

00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,700
of my apartment.

00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,100
I tried to

00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,200
be reasonable. The

00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,000
first time, I

00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,600
knocked on his

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,700
door and politely

00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,299
asked him to

00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:01,700
turn it down.

00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,500
He apologized profusely,

00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,599
claiming he didn't

00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,500
realize how loud

00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,099
it was and

00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,400
promised it wouldn't

00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:07,799
happen again. But

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:07,900
it did. Again

00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,700
and again. Each

00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,599
time, the same

00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,500
empty apologies, followed

00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,099
by more noise.

00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,799
I started documenting

00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:20,099
everything: dates, times,

00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:21,200
descriptions of the

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,400
noise, and my

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:22,900
attempts to contact

00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,099
him. I even

00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:25,299
invested in a

00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:25,900
decibel meter to

00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,900
accurately measure the

00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,099
sound levels, which

00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:29,400
consistently exceeded the

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,299
complex's regulations. I

00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,000
complained to the

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,900
apartment management, but

00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,400
they were slow

00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,599
to respond. They

00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,200
sent him a

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,900
few warnings, but

00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,900
the noise persisted.

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,799
It was clear

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,599
that Mark had

00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,299
no respect for

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,099
his neighbors or

00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:40,700
the rules of

00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,099
the complex. The

00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:43,000
constant noise was

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,900
affecting my work,

00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,799
my sleep, and

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,000
my sanity. I

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,900
was constantly on

00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,200
edge, dreading the

00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,000
next eruption of

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,500
sound. That's when

00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,099
I decided that

00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:51,700
if the apartment

00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,700
management wasn't going

00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,200
to do anything,

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
I would have

00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,799
to take matters

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,299
into my own

00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:56,599
hands. I started

00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,700
formulating a plan,

00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,799
a way to

00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,400
give Mark a

00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,700
taste of his

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,799
own medicine, but

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,299
in a way

00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:01,700
that was both

00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,099
subtle and undeniable.

00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:04,599
I knew I

00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,299
couldn't stoop to

00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:06,099
his level and

00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:06,799
create a disturbance

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,099
myself. Instead, I

00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:09,500
would use his

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,300
own love of

00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,300
loud music against

00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,599
him. My plan

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,599
began with researching

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,900
sound frequencies. I

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,800
discovered that certain

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,000
frequencies are particularly

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,800
irritating to the

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,900
human ear, even

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,000
at relatively low

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,199
volumes. I then

00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:22,800
purchased a small,

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
inconspicuous device that

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,300
could emit these

00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,800
frequencies. It looked

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,400
like an ordinary

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,900
air freshener, but

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,400
it was capable

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,599
of producing a

00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,000
range of sounds

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,099
undetectable to most

00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:33,300
people, but incredibly

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,000
annoying to those

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,800
sensitive to them.

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,599
Next, I waited

00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,000
for the perfect

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,699
opportunity. It came

00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:39,099
a few days

00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:39,900
later when Mark

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,699
hosted another one

00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:41,500
of his infamous

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,699
parties. As the

00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:43,800
music blared and

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,599
the bass thumped,

00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,699
I activated my

00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,099
device. I placed

00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,400
it strategically near

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,199
the shared wall

00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,199
between our apartments,

00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,400
ensuring that the

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,800
irritating frequencies would

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,699
be directed towards

00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:54,199
his living room.

00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,199
At first, nothing

00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:56,800
seemed to happen.

00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,599
The party continued

00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,300
in full swing.

00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,199
But then, I

00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,000
noticed a subtle

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,599
shift. People started

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,400
looking uncomfortable, their

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
faces contorted in

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,699
slight frowns. The

00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:09,000
conversations became less

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,599
animated, the laughter

00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,099
less frequent. Some

00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:12,800
guests started leaving

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,199
early, citing headaches

00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,099
or feeling unwell.

00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,599
Mark, too, seemed

00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,000
affected. He kept

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,699
adjusting the volume

00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,199
of the music,

00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,000
trying to find

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,900
a sweet spot

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,599
that would appease

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,900
his guests. But

00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,400
no matter what

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,300
he did, the

00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,500
atmosphere remained tense

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,099
and uncomfortable. Eventually,

00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:28,699
the party fizzled

00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:29,400
out, much earlier

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,800
than usual. The

00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
next morning, I

00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,400
saw Mark outside,

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,199
looking tired and

00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,500
haggard. He glared

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:35,800
at me as

00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,300
I walked past,

00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,300
but I simply

00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,400
smiled sweetly and

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,000
wished him a

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,300
good day. He

00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,800
didn't say a

00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,300
word. The parties

00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:42,900
stopped after that.

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,400
Mark still played

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,000
his music, but

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,599
at a much

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,599
more reasonable volume.

00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,699
And whenever I

00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:48,199
heard it getting

00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,599
too loud, I

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,500
would simply activate

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,800
my device, and

00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,500
the noise would

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,800
quickly subside. He

00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,400
never knew what

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,099
was causing the

00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:56,400
discomfort, but he

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,300
clearly understood that

00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,900
something was making

00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,800
his music less

00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,500
enjoyable. My life

00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,099
has returned to

00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:02,099
its peaceful state.

00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,199
The silence in

00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:03,699
my apartment is

00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:04,599
once again a

00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,099
source of comfort

00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,400
and inspiration. And

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,800
every time I

00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,400
hear a faint

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,099
thump from Mark's

00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:08,900
apartment, I smile,

00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,099
knowing that I

00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:10,599
have the power

00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,199
to restore the

00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,400
peace. He may

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:12,800
have thought he

00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,300
could disrupt my

00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,500
life without consequence,

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,300
but he learned

00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:15,900
the hard way

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,500
that even the

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,500
quietest of neighbors

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:17,899
can have their

00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:18,399
revenge.
